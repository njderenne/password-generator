# Password Generator

## Application Description

A flexible password generator that will take user input to create a password specifically tailored to your needs. The password created will be completely random and based on the input characters chosen by the user.

## How it works

When the application is ran a prompt will appear asking for password length followed by the character inputs allowed. At this point the application will output the randomly generated password.
